## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Material UI

### What I learned

This is the first time i make a landing page of this type so it was pretty challenging for me and it may not be perfect but i think the result isn't that bad, i loved making this page.

### Continued development

My biggest challenge in the making of this page was the images, because they could look good on a certain screen size but when i shrinked the window they didn't look good anymore, so it was a challenge for me trying to make them look good in every screen size possible, so i would like to continue learning about how to handle that easily.

### Useful resources

- [Popover](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-popover/) - I used Material UI for the popover menu, this is the official documentation that helped me achieve that.
